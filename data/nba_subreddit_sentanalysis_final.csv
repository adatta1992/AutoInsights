nba,[the only reason anyone knows who Jared Dudley is is because Ben Simmons said his name. The last time he made headlines was 5 years ago when he was dumped at sea by the Bucks for a 2nd round pick. Let this guy’s talent do the talking.](https://imgur.com/gallery/HYke9sc),negative

nba,I just got a 29 on the ACT. Been excited asf all day but haven't told a single soul yet.,positive
nba,You can't seriously think this is rigged for the Warriors when the refs let players maul Curry off ball the entire game. Curry would easily be shooting 14 free throws a game if the refs were trying to rig it for them.,negative
nba,"Let's calculate how much we have to make the three worth to get to this. If it was worth 2.675 points instead of 3 would we achieve the perfect harmony of offensive strategy? 

Let's go all out and embrace the video game world. The NBA and video games seem to have the same general audience already, why not further blur those lines? 

Getting back to back blocks on the same player in the same possession gives your team a red shell and automatically forces the opposing coach to sub out that player in shame at the next dead ball and keep them on the bench for at least five minutes of game time. 

Maybe add rewards for consecutive made shots of the same type being worth more or less. Hit three ""three's"" in a row and unlock a holographic power star. Power stars grant you +1 points per made shot, +0.5 points per assisted shot, and immunity from foul calls for 30 seconds. 

Lastly golden mushrooms, players that get a golden mushroom have to take it and play the next game.",neutral

nba,"In Toronto Kawhi has been great, he's friendly with team mates and coaching staff, he seems to have been prepping all year to have a serious run in the playoffs, and is now doing that. He went on Ibaka's youtube show. I'm sure he's been the one dictating the load management, but it looks like it was for the best anyway.

Honest question, why would he be acting so different in TO than in SA, especially given that everyone thinks he'll leave TO anyway in the summer?

nba,"This assumes that the only difference between wide open shots and contested shots is the need to desire to draw fouls. It is also plausible that contested shots need more power, arc or something else compared to a wide open shots.

It's growing pretty rapidly. I think Curb'd had a pretty good article, or some site, essentially, there's a huge skilled workforce in LA that hasn't been tapped like in Silicon Valley. The big giants figured why not capitalize on that.

Amazon just moved into the steps. Google is moving into Westside Pavillion. Facebook, Yahoo, and Google are in Playa Vista

Not disagreeing with you that Harden did undercut Curry on one of them, didn't see the CP3 one to judge but you cannot be serious with a Warriors flair saying all of this and put yourself on some sort of pedestal, it's quite ironic. I don't believe for a second that Klay, Harden, or CP3 were intentionally trying to hurt anyone on their undercuts in game 1 but I do believe that a Zaza intentionally tried to hurt Kawhi, which is what makes your post extremely funny to me.",negative

nba,"Every once in while I get the urge to chime in on one of these anti-CP3 threads to tell this story and ask for help tracking down this segment:

Several years ago (pre-2014), I believe it was on Zach Lowe's podcast, a sportswriter (I want to say Arnovitz, but I'm not sure) relayed a story about interviewing CP3 where he got into a tense back-and-forth with CP around a series of 'spirit of the rule' type questions where he was asking him about whether or not he thought flopping, grabbing arms, and otherwise trying to do 'illegal' things on the court was 'moral' or within 'the spirit of the game/rule' and the sportswriter got really frustrated because CP was pretending to not understand the concept and conflating 'getting caught' with 'doing wrong'. Essentially, CP seems to believe that what makes a thing 'bad' is whether or not you are caught doing it. 

You can understand so much of CP's career in light of this comment. From the punching of dicks, the flopping, his routine excessive contact, etc. all of the things people dislike about CP are summed up in that exchange. He's an immoral, dirty basketball player that most importantly **should not be president of the NBA players' union** because he routinely shows little to no respect for his colleagues, as evidenced by his on court behavior.",negative

nba,The refs are supposed to be the arbitrary arm of NBA play. If they fire a ref because popular players like him then the sets a terrible precedent. People would let big time players like Harden slide on fouls because they would have the power to put refs out of a job. Sure players get fined for commenting on officiating but I'm pretty sure Harden is fine with his $228 million contract.,negative
